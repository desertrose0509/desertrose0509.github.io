			<li> I have 12 years of experience designing, building and managing content of engaging intranet websites for American Express. All three of my websites consistently ranked in the top five most visited websites out of 150 American Express intranet webpages.</li>
			<li>Successful websites start with engaging content that users want to read. Before I start the design process, I analyze the content and conduct a user experience analysis first. Then I create a website that effectively and easily communicates the desired message.</li>
			<li>Once the websites are built, I conduct user experience testing and analyze web analytics weekly to check the engagement on the site. I then redesign any pages that aren't catching the attention of the users. </li>
			<li>I have written over 1400 intranet articles for American Express. In addition, I have written over 150 articles internet articles that were published on LIVESTRONG, FRS, Tyra Banks Beauty and Fashion and OneAZ Credit Union websites.</li>

			<h2> Case Studies</h2>
			<section>
				<h3>American Express Finance</h3>
				<p> American Express needed a central intranet website created and managed for the 700 employees of their financial center in Phoenix, Arizona that housed six separate divisions. Three of the divisions already had designed their own unique web pages that needed to be integrated into the new central website. </p>
				<p>To create the new website, I first analyzed the content for the page and created a design to effectively communicate the information. I met with the content managers of the three division's who had created their own websites, and showed them how we'd incorporate their webpages into the new website.</p>
				<p>After identifying content managers for each of the six finance divisions, I conducted group training on basic HTML coding and provided each person with technical support. Classes on Adobe Dreamweaver were also available to those who didn't want to learn HTML.</p>
				<p>The result was I built and managed one cohesive website for the Phoenix center that effectively communicated business objectives, company and center news as well as details on campus events. The website also provided knowledge sharing opportunites for employees to learn more about the other finance divisions at the center. Omniture (now Adobe Sitecatalyst) web analytics revealed the new webpage ranked consistently in the top 5 of all 150 American Express global intranet webpages.</p>

				<h3>American Express Merchant Services</h3>
				<p>The Merchant Services division had a poorly organized website that was attracting an average of five users out of 600 mostly call center employees. They needed a website that would communicate division news and events, generate employee engagement and provide recognition for employees.</p>
				<p> After conducting a user analysis, I redesigned the website with eye-catching graphics and an attractive color palette. I added a photo and quote of the day feature to the homepage and coupled those with the latest headlines. I inserted photo and video pages to display event and recognition digital media. A calendar feature updated employees on upcoming events and housed documents needed for scheduled meetings.</p>
				<p>The result was an engaging webpage that clicked with employees and consistently ranked in the top 5 of all 150 American Express global intranet webpages. Merchant Services employees looked at the webpage daily along with several other users from other global American Express divisions.</p>

				<h3>OneAZ Credit Union</h3>
				<p>OneAZ Credit Union's digital marketing was handled by three marketing specialists who worked independentally of each other. Daily social media postings were handled by an outside digital marketing company. They needed to bring all of the digital players in-house and around the same digital table to achieve the best results.</p>
				<p>After input from the other marketing team members, I created one comprehensive Digital Content Calendar with schedules of daily social media posts, marketing emails, newsletters and event follow-up messages. Schedule was in place at the start of each month and helped make the team more efficient. It also prevented credit union members from receiving multiple messages from OneAZ on the same day.</p>
				<p>I assumed management of OneAZ's daily social media posts and aligned the posts with the marketing efforts shown on the new Digital Content Calendar. I also highlighted several of the great products and services the credit union offered members that they probably weren't aware of. The result was increased Twitter activity and a 1400% increase in Facebook reach from 40 to 600 views a day. Prompt response to any member complaints on Facebook or Yelp! changed several unhappy customers back into OneAZ Credit Union satisfied members again.</p>
